  <p class="lead">After years of laborious research, sampling and field trips down
  to the region of Champagne we decided that it was about time to bring a slice
  of our passion for Champagne back home with us to Guernsey. We hope that when
  you enter our boutique you will feel the magic of the French Champagne region
  around you. We believe that every bottle has a story; our aim is to articulate it.</p>

<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1">
  <p>Our in-house experts will educate and guide you through the wide range of bottles
    we offer, enabling you to discover something new at each visit. By introducing you
    to some of the lesser-known house names we hope that you will begin to realise that
    there really is a different Champagne for every occasion and one to suit every budget.</p>

  <p>Champagne lovers are in for a real treat with our unique subscription packages which
    include delivery directly to your doorstep, or why not treat your friends or colleagues
    to a bespoke tasting evening, sampling a fine range of houses and vintages?</p>

  <p>Donâ€™t save your bubbles just for special occasions, Champagne is always appropriate!
